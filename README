This project is a solution to the "Million Songs Dataset Challenge"
programming contest. A detailed explanation of the presented task along
with the final ranklist can be found at:

  http://www.kaggle.com/c/msdchallenge/

The solution is implemented in C++ and depends on POSIX Threads. To compile
the solution under a Linux run the command:

  make solution

To simplify starting the program on the full contest dataset a simple Bash
script is provided. To start it enter the following command:

  ./run.sh

Details for a more fine grained configuration can be found by reading the
source file src/solution/main.cc.

The project's source code can be found in the "src" directory. When reading
the code it is advisable to start with the header files and the main driver
program main.cc. The "data" directory contains the input data provided by
the contest organizers. The organizers also provide tools to partially validate
the output files generated by the contestants. These tools are located in the
"validator" directory. A detailed explanation of the solution and the
algorithms that it uses can be found in:
