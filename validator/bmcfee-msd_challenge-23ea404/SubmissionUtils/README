Scripts to help you prepare and validate your Kaggle submission file
for the MSD Challenge.


SCRIPT 1: Submission validation
--------

This script download canonical files from the web (user and songs)
and verify that the submission has the right format:
- 110K x 500, space-separated integers
- no duplicates per line
- integers are plausible song indexes

   python validate_submission.py help
   python validate_submission.py <submission file>



SCRIPT 2: From song IDs to song indexes
--------

All the data is release with song IDs, e.g. 'SOAAADD12AB018A9DD', so it is
natural to have a prediction file with one user and many song IDs per line, e.g.
    user1     SOABC     SODEF    SOGHI    .....
Problem: to predict many thousand songs per user, it makes a very large text
file, difficult to upload to Kaggle.
Therefoore, Kaggle expect a file containing 'song ID' IDs, which are an
integer. The mapping (song ID -> integer) is available in the file:
   'kaggle_songs.txt'  on the Kaggle's challenge page.

The following codes download the mapping, and convert your file for you:

   python convert_to_song_index.py  <prediction file> <submission file>
where
   <prediction file>    contains 'SOAAADD12AB018A9DD'
   <submission file>    contains integers
